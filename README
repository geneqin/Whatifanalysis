1. read network topology and nodes link capability from file "network" and "flow"
2. uncomment lastwo lines of Portal.java to generate processor.txt. then comment those two lines.
3. run Potal.Java and get the Maude specification for all nodes (if applicable)
4. add the specification into MaudeFW/whatifnodesimple.maude
5. In windows: open cygwin and go to MaudeFW dir, run "./maude whatifnodesimple.maude > result.txt"
	 In Linux: open terminal and go to the MaudeFW dir, run"./maude.linux whatifnodesimple.maude > result.txt"
6. run MaudeResultParser.java to get the analysis result.

=======================================
current version only consider delay parameters. and use Poisson process to decribe the traffic flow arrival.
